							<h1>Hi There, I'm Patrick</h1>
							<p class="major">I am currently a rising Senior at the University of Notre Dame studying Chemical Engineering. I have recently been fascinated
							by how quickly technology is advancing, and how it is impacting businesses and our world. One of the biggest benefits of this rapid
						  technology growth is the ability to have so much information at our fingertips. This is what drove me to want to build this website. As
						  someone interested in technology consulting I felt teaching myself to build a website would be not only a great way to expand my skillset, but
							also a fun exercise that takes advantage of the wealth of free learning tools that exist on the internet. To learn more about
						  the projects I have worked on, my skills, and my experiences scroll down!</p>

							<h2>River Bend Cancer Services</h2>
							<p>During the first semester of my Junior year, I was fortunate enough to lead a Consulting Consortium project working with River Bend
							Cancer Services in South Bend, Indiana. Our begginning goal was simply to help the center better utilize the SalesForce software
						  that had recently been donated. My team of 8 ND students was able to create a deliverable and train employees on how to use
						  Microsoft Access in correlation with SalesForce to create clean reports, which could then be used to better compete for non-profit
						  funding requests.</p>
